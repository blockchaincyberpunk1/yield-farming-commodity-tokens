To-Do List
Smart Contract Development:
Write the CommodityToken.sol contract to define the commodity-backed token logic.
Write the YieldFarming.sol contract to handle staking, unstaking, and yield distribution.
Ensure contracts are upgradable if business logic changes.
Testing:
Write tests for CommodityToken.sol in commodityToken.test.js.
Write tests for YieldFarming.sol in yieldFarming.test.js.
Use Hardhat's network to run tests to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Frontend Development:
Set up the React project within the frontend/ directory.
Develop the StakeForm.js component for users to stake their tokens.
Develop the YieldView.js component to display the accrued yield to the users.
Ensure the frontend is responsive and user-friendly.
Deployment and Integration:
Create a script in deploy.js to deploy smart contracts using Hardhat.
Configure Hardhat to deploy to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby) and eventually to the main network.
Integrate the frontend with the smart contracts using Ethers.js to enable interactive transactions.
Environment Setup:
Set up .env with necessary configuration settings (e.g., private keys, Infura endpoint).
Configure hardhat.config.js for development and production environments.
Testing and Launch:
Conduct thorough testing of the entire application, both contracts and frontend.
Deploy the application to a testnet for live testing.
Adjust based on feedback and prepare for final deployment.
Maintenance and Updates:
Monitor contracts and frontend for any issues.
Plan for future updates and potential scaling solutions.
