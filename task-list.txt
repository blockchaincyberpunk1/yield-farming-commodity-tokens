Task List and Coding Order
1. Smart Contract Development
Files to Code:
CommodityToken.sol: Define the ERC-20 token representing the commodity-backed tokens.
YieldFarming.sol: Implements the logic for staking tokens, calculating yields, and distributing rewards.
2. Smart Contract Testing
Files to Code:
commodityToken.test.js: Tests the functionalities of CommodityToken.sol like token issuance, transfers, and allowances.
yieldFarming.test.js: Tests the staking, yield calculation, and reward distribution functionalities of YieldFarming.sol.
3. Deployment Scripts
Files to Code:
deploy.js: Script to deploy the contracts to the Ethereum network using Hardhat.
4. Frontend Development
Files to Code:
src/index.js: Entry point for the React application, setting up the main rendering.
src/App.js: Main application component, which integrates all sub-components.
src/components/StakeForm.js: Component to handle the staking of commodity tokens.
src/components/YieldView.js: Component to display the calculated yields to the user.
src/styles/main.css: Main CSS file for styling the frontend components.
public/index.html: Basic HTML template for the React application.
5. Environment and Configuration Setup
Files to Code:
.env: Environment variables including private keys and network URLs.
hardhat.config.js: Hardhat configuration for networks and other project settings.
Suggested Coding Order:
Start with Smart Contracts:
Code CommodityToken.sol first as it's the foundation for the tokenomics.
Follow up with YieldFarming.sol, which depends on the commodity token logic.
Move to Contract Testing:
Test CommodityToken.sol with commodityToken.test.js.
Test YieldFarming.sol with yieldFarming.test.js to ensure the main logic works correctly.
Set Up Deployment Scripts:
Prepare deploy.js to facilitate easy and efficient deployment of the contracts.
Develop the Frontend:
Start with src/index.js and src/App.js to set up the basic React structure.
Code src/components/StakeForm.js and src/components/YieldView.js to enable user interaction.
Style the components using src/styles/main.css.
Ensure the public/index.html is correctly set up to host the React app.
Finalize Environment and Configuration:
Configure hardhat.config.js and .env for development and production environments.
